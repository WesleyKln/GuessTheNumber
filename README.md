#  Guess The Number


Welcome to ***Guess The Number***, a game in Command Line.

The program randomly determines a number between 0 and 100 that it keeps secret. Then the user is prompted to guess the number in question. He comes up with a number, and the game tells him if the number to find is greater than or less than the ***secret number***.

If the user comes up with the correct number, he won.

The goal is to find the ***secret number*** by making the fewest attempts.
At the end, the game tells the user their number of attempts.

### **AI version :**
I implemented a basic ***AI*** that it will behave like a virtual player. In ***AI*** mode, the program will run on its own to find the ***secret number***.

## **Installation :**

1. To start the game in ***normal mode***, with a physical player :

   $ java path/to/Main.java

2. Launch the game in ***AI mode*** :

   $ java path / to / Main.java --ai
